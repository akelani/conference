Hey Guys,

This is a great example of our app for ShowKit. We have docs in progress at http://docs.showk.it/docs so you guys can mess around a little.

This is a little demo @xiaowoo prepared for the video-to-video component. We are also working on demos for screen sharing, and gesture sharing.

I'd love to hear some feedback of what you think so far!
